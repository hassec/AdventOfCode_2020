# AdventOfCode_2020
Having a go at AOC with Haskell, since it's my first time with Haskell I'm taking it slow.  
Also there is snow in the alps so I'm skiing more often than coding right now... :D

**Note:** This is my first ever attempt to code in Haskell, so please feel free to have a look but take everything you see with a grain of salt.       
Or rather a kilo, to be safe :D
